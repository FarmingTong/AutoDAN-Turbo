## Abstract ðŸ“š

Jailbreak attacks serve as essential red-teaming tools, proactively assessing whether LLMs can behave responsibly and
safely in adversarial environments. Despite diverse strategies (e.g., cipher, low-resource language, persuasions, and so
on) that have been proposed, they still rely on human-designed strategies, limiting their scope and effectiveness as a
red-teaming tool. In this paper, we propose **_AutoDAN-Turbo_**, a black-box jailbreak framework that **can automatically
discover as many jailbreak strategies as possible from scratch, without any human intervention or predefined scopes (
e.g., specified candidate strategies).** As a result, AutoDAN-Turbo can automatically develop diverse jailbreak attack
strategies and significantly outperform baseline methods, achieving a 74.3% higher average attack success rate on public
benchmarks. Notably, AutoDAN-Turbo achieves an 88.5% success rate on GPT-4-1106-turbo.
In addition, **_AutoDAN-Turbo_** is a unified framework that **can incorporate existing human-designed jailbreak strategies in a
plug-and-play manner.** By integrating these strategies, AutoDAN-Turbo can even achieve a higher success rate of 93.4% on
GPT-4-1106-turbo.

## Getting Started ðŸŒ±
AutoDAN-Turbo is compatible with a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs, whether black-box or white-box. It offers methods for API compatibility with platforms such as OpenAI, Claude, and GeminiPro.

### Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PeiranLi0930/AutoDAN-Turbo

export ATTACKER_PATH = "llama-3-8b" # attacker LLM path
export TARGET_PATH = "llama-3-8b" # target LLM path
export SCORER_PATH = "llama-3-8b" # scorer LLM path
export SUMMARIZER_PATH = "llama-3-8b" # summarizer LLM path

python main.py --malicious_behavior warmup_behaviors.xlsx --tolerance 150 --epoch 1 --mode online-learning --attacker $ATTACKER --target $TARGET --scorer $SCORER --summarizer $SUMMARIZER
```
main.py argument list:
- `--malicious_behavior`: the path to the malicious behavior file
- `--tolerance`: the tolerance for the jailbreak rounds
- `--epoch`: the number of times for jailbreak rounds/attempts on each malicious behavior
- `--mode`: online learning by default
- `--log`: path to the log file
- `--attacker`: the attacker LLM path
- `--target`: the target LLM path
- `--scorer`: the scorer LLM path
- `--summarizer`: the summarizer LLM path

### Implementation Details
The specific usage instructions for all classes and methods covered in each Python file are provided as comments within the respective files. Please read them carefully.
- `prompts.py`

    This includes the system prompts for the attacker, scorer, target, and summarizer LLMs during the exploration of different jailbreak strategies.


- `models.py`

    In this Python file, we have included classes for instantiating the Attacker, Target, Summarizer, and Scorer. Each class features a method named `update_hyperparameters(json_config)` that allows users to adjust the LLM's hyperparameters in real-time. Additionally, we provide classes for integrating with closed-source LLMs such as Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, and Claude.


- `main.py`

    The initialization of the AutoDAN-Turbo pipeline begins with `main.py`. Please follow the instructions provided in the Quick Start section to execute the process.


- `harmbench.xlsx`

    This file originates from HarmBench and encompasses 400 distinct malicious behaviors designed to assess the performance of jailbreak pipelines and methods. It is important to note that some behaviors require appropriate contextual settings, which we have pre-configured for you in `main.py`.


- `database_organizer.py`

    In this Python file, we offer two classes, `DB1_Builder` and `DB2_Builder`, which together streamline the conversion of complex jailbreak logs (`log.txt`) into well-organized and clear tabular files. `DB1_Builder` constructs the Dialogue Library mentioned in our main text, while `DB2_Builder` forms the Strategy Library.

    Additionally, we provide methods to select suitable strategies from the existing Strategy Library for subsequent jailbreak attempts:

  - `strategy_selector`: For each Target Response generated, we filter out the top 5 most appropriate jailbreak strategies for the next attempt.
  - `analyze_clusters`: This helper method for `strategy_selector` clusters all past Target Responses.
    
  Usage Example:
    ```python
    augmented_embeddings, n_clusters, scaler = analyze_clusters("responses.pt") # responses.pt preserves ALL previous Target Response 
    selected_strategies = strategy_selector("db2.xlsx", target_response, augmented_embeddings, scaler) # select top-5 strategies for the next jailbreak attempt/round
    ```
  
-  `warmup_behaviors.xlsx`

    This file includes 50 malicious behaviors intended to initialize our Strategy Library. During this phase, the Attacker will operate without any strategy limitations, allowing for the free exploration of all potential jailbreak methods that may prove effective.
